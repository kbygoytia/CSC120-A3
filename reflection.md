needed help with figuring out how to use random in Java so I found this helpful https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21726033/picking-a-random-item-from-an-array-of-strings-in-java

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It is very scary and confusing but I understood it by the end after getting help. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

Python (in my opinion at least) is less human friendly because it had less enlgish phrases which made it a bit harder to write code. Meanwhile Java is more human friendly mainly because it uses more enlgish phrases to describe what the code does. However, since i learned python first I think my brain got very confused with how much english is in Java that it took a bit to understand it. I think both languages try their best to serve the human so they can have an easier time translating their verbal thoughts to code and depending on the task and person either language might benefit them more.   

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I worked on creating the list of canned words, creating the list that the user input and computer words will be appeneded into, and the for loop for the transcript. Then Julie created the for loop for rounds and we connected it together. We also both worked on the if statements for comparing the idex in split_words with the mirror words list so we could swap them out. 

What did not work was a lot of the language technicalities like how if you want to compare the value in a list at a certain index to another value of a list in a certain index you need to use .equals() not ==. Also we had other issues with syntax that we needed to look into or ask for help with. There was also an issue with curly braces and either something being inside the curly brace for loop that shoul not be there or a curly brace completely missing which causes issues. 

Advice: Pseudo code like you have never Pseudo coded before. It was our best friend during this process because we were able to almost draw out what we wanted our program to do and then break that down into bite size pieces.
